						------ WE HAVE TO CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE DJANGO --------

Step 1: Create a New Virtual Environment(system-dependent) inside the Django folder. We need to navigate to my project folder.
	a. open the VS code terminal
	b. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

		1. cd Django 						(to locate the Django folder)
		2. python -m venv venv3 (or) pip install vertualenv	(this create a new environment named venv3).

Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment.
	After creating the new environment, activate it using:

		3. venv3\Scripts\activate				(We should now see(venv3) in the terminal, which means the environment in active).

Step 3: Install the Required Packages, and libraries.

		4. pip install Django==4.2
		5. pip install mysqlclient
